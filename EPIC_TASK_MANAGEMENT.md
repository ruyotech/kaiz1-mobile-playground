## Data Flow

### Creating an Epic with Tasks
```

3. Modal shows available tasks (epicId === null)
4. User selects tasks (multi-select)
5. User clicks "Done"
6. Selected tasks shown in form
7. User clicks "Create Epic"
8. Epic created with:
   - taskIds array
   - totalPoints = sum of selected task points
   - completedPoints = sum of "done" task points
9. Navigate back to epic list
```

### Adding Task to Existing Epic
```
1. User opens epic detail
2. User clicks "Add Task"
3. Modal shows available tasks
4. User taps task
5. epicStore.addTaskToEpic(epicId, taskId)
6. taskStore.updateTask(taskId, { epicId })
7. Task appears in epic's task list
8. Epic stats recalculate
```

### Removing Task from Epic
```
1. User clicks X on task in epic detail
2. epicStore.removeTaskFromEpic(epicId, taskId)

## Mock Data Structure

### Epic Example
```json

  "title": "Launch Mobile App",
  "description": "Build and launch the mobile version of our app",
  "userId": "user-1",
  "lifeWheelAreaId": "lw-2",
  "targetSprintId": "sprint-6",

  "totalPoints": 39,
  "completedPoints": 13,
  "color": "#3B82F6",

  "createdAt": "2026-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Updated Task Structure
```json
{
  "id": "task-1",
  "title": "Design login screen UI",

## UI/UX Highlights

### Design Principles
1. **Color-Coded Identity** - Each epic has unique color for instant recognition
2. **Visual Progress** - Progress bars with percentage and points
3. **Clear Hierarchy** - Epic → Tasks relationship is obvious
4. **Quick Actions** - Add/remove tasks with single tap
5. **Empty States** - Helpful guidance when no data exists
6. **Real-time Updates** - Stats recalculate instantly on changes

### Color Usage
- **Blue (#3B82F6)** - Default, productivity

## Technical Notes

### State Management
- Epic and Task stores are separate but coordinated
- Updates happen synchronously (no API calls yet)
- TaskIds array is source of truth for epic-task relationship
- Both `epicId` in Task and `taskIds` in Epic must stay in sync

### Performance
- FlatList for efficient rendering of long lists
- No unnecessary re-renders (proper key extraction)
- Modal loads only when opened
- Calculated stats cached during render

### Data Integrity
- When task added: epic.taskIds.push() AND task.epicId = epicId
- When task removed: epic.taskIds.filter() AND task.epicId = null
- Points recalculated from actual task data, not stored separately
- Orphaned tasks (epicId points to non-existent epic) handled gracefully

## Summary

The Epic-Task Management system transforms epics from static containers into dynamic strategic instruments. Users can:

1. **Create epics** with visual identity (color + icon)
2. **Add/remove tasks** dynamically
3. **Track progress** in real-time
4. **View task context** (which epic they belong to)
5. **Organize work** into meaningful strategic goals

This foundation enables future enhancements like AI planning, templates, social sharing, and financial tracking - all aligned with the Kaiz LifeOS vision of treating life like an Agile product.
