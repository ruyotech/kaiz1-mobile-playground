## 🚧 Features Removed for Launch Phase

The following features have been temporarily removed to focus on core functionality for the initial launch. They will be added back in post-launch iterations:

### 📊 Reports & Analytics
A comprehensive analytics dashboard that provides:
- Task completion metrics and velocity tracking
- Sprint performance visualization
- Focus time analytics from Pomodoro sessions
- Challenge completion statistics
- Cross-feature performance reports

**Why Removed:** The reports feature requires significant backend infrastructure for data aggregation and visualization. To ensure a stable launch, we're focusing on core task management and challenge features first. Analytics will be gradually introduced as we collect sufficient user data.

### 💰 Bills Management
A bill tracking system with features including:
- Bill tracking with payment status (paid, unpaid, overdue)
- OCR scanning for automatic bill data extraction
- Recurring bill management
- Payment reminders and notifications
- Category-based organization
- Financial analytics and spending insights

**Why Removed:** The bills feature involves financial data management, payment integrations, and OCR processing that require additional security considerations and third-party service integrations. We're deferring this to ensure proper security measures and compliance are in place before handling financial information.
