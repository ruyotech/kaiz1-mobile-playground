## Epic Badge Component (Reusable Pattern)

**Design System:**
```tsx
{taskEpic && (
    <View 
        className="px-3 py-1 rounded-full flex-row items-center"
        style={{ 
            backgroundColor: taskEpic.color + '20', 
            borderColor: taskEpic.color, 
            borderWidth: 1 
        }}
    >
        <MaterialCommunityIcons 
            name={taskEpic.icon as any} 
            size={12} 
            color={taskEpic.color} 
        />
        <Text 
            className="text-xs font-bold ml-1" 
            style={{ color: taskEpic.color }}
        >
            {taskEpic.title}
        </Text>
    </View>
)}
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Background:** Epic color at 20% opacity
- **Border:** Epic color at 100% opacity (1px)
- **Icon:** Epic icon at 12px size
- **Text:** Epic title, bold, color-matched
- **Shape:** Rounded pill (full border radius)
- **Responsive:** Text truncates if too long

---

## Visual Design Principles

### 1. Color Usage
- Epic colors used consistently across all screens
- 20% opacity for backgrounds (subtle, not overwhelming)
- 100% opacity for borders and text (clear visibility)

### 2. Typography
- **Task titles:** Bold, 16-18px
- **Epic badges:** Bold, 12px (small but readable)
- **Story points:** Bold with badge background
- **Descriptions:** Regular, 14px

### 3. Spacing
- Consistent padding: 12-16px
- Badge gaps: 8px (gap-2)
- Card margins: 12-16px

### 4. Touch Targets
- Minimum 44x44px for interactive elements
- Story point cards: 56x56px
- Epic selector cards: Full width, 64px height

## User Benefits

### For Users
✅ **Visual Context** - Immediately see which epic a task belongs to
✅ **Strategic Awareness** - Understand how tasks contribute to bigger goals
✅ **Better Organization** - Filter and find tasks by epic affiliation
✅ **Consistent Experience** - Same epic visual identity everywhere
✅ **Modern UI** - Beautiful, professional interface

### For Product

✅ **Engagement** - Visual appeal encourages more interaction
✅ **Feature Discovery** - Users naturally discover epic system
✅ **User Education** - Visual cues teach app structure organically

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **Load Epics:** All screens now fetch epics on mount
2. **Find Task Epic:** `epics.find(e => e.id === task.epicId)`
3. **Render Badge:** Conditional rendering when epic exists
4. **Color Theming:** Dynamic styling based on epic color

### Performance
- Epics loaded once per screen (not per task)
- Find operation is O(n) but n is small (typically < 20 epics)
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient conditional rendering

### Scalability
- Design supports any number of epics
- Text truncation prevents overflow
- Responsive to screen sizes
- Works with all Material Community Icons

---

✅ Epic properly linked on task creation
